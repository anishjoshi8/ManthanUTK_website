									<h1>Prospective Students</h1>
									<p>If you are on this page, you are probably interested in University of Tennessee, Knoxville or you are a student/visiting scholar at UTK. We think that the below links will be a good start to get more details in this regard.</p>

								<h3>Prospective Indian Students</h3></font>
								<p>Thank you for your interest in the university of Tennessee. In the following paragraph, we have explained about some of the  requirements which are necessary. We have listed specific guidelines below showing the information required to complete your application.</p>
								<p><li><font size="3"><u> OFFICIAL MARKSHEETS AND DEGREE CONFIRMATION FROM ALL UNIVERSITIES ATTENDED:-</u> All individual attested marksheets from each university you have attended are required. Consolidated marksheets are not acceptable. The marksheets should be from the degree-granting university rather than the affiliated college. The marksheets and final degree confirmation should be attested by an academic official of the university issuing the marksheets (Registrar or Controller of Exams). Those verified by a notary are not considered official.</font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><u> FOR GRADUATE APPLICANTS, ALL BUT THE FINAL SEMESTER OF WORK IS NEEDED ON OFFICIAL MARKSHEETS FOR A TENTATIVE ADMISSION DECISION:-</u> If you are enrolled in a 10-semester program, we must have a minimum of 9 semesters on official marksheets before an evaluation can be conducted. If you are enrolled in an 8-semester bachelor degree program, we must have at least 7 semesters for an evaluation. The Graduate School and academic departments do not feel an informed decision can be made when a full year of work is missing. No exception can be made. We understand the possible frustration and will make every effort to process your application as quickly as possible upon receipt of the needed marksheets and final degree confirmation. </font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><u> FOR GRADUATE APPLICANTS WITH A TWO- OR THREE-YEAR BACHELOR DEGREE:-</u> To qualify for graduate admission, applicants from India must present a post-graduate diploma in addition to the BA, BSc, or BCom degree. The post-graduate diploma may be a Master of Arts, Science, Commerce, or Education. The Bachelor of Technology or Engineering degree qualifies applicants for consideration for graduate school admission.</font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><u> OFFICIAL SCORES:-</u> On the Test of English as a Foreign Language received from Educational Testing Service. </font></p> </li>

								<p><li><font size="3"><u> APPLICATION FORM:-</u> A completed application form accompanied by an application fee of $60.00 in U.S. currency. THERE IS NO FEE WAIVER. If there is a problem with exchange of currency, you may wish to contact a friend or relative in the U.S. who will pay this fee for you. </font></p> </li>

								<p><font size="3"> <strong><u>Note:-</u></strong> All documents submitted to the Office of Graduate Admissions become the property of the University of Tennessee and cannot be returned.</font></p>

								<h3>Upon Arrival</h3></font>
								<p><font size="3">Once you arrive at UTK, we think that you cannot afford to miss the following:</font></p>
								<p><font size="3"><strong>Orientation:</strong></font>
								</p>
								<p><font size="3">It is the single most important thing to attend once you are at UTK. If you do not attend Orientation with CIE your program will be terminated. All students whose native language is NOT English are usually required to take the exam.</font>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li text-align="left"><font size="3"> International Student Orientation</font></li>
									<li><font size="3"> Graduate Student Orientation </font></li>
								</ul>
								<p><font size="3"><strong>Insurance:</strong></font>
								</p>
								<p><font size="3">Medical expenses in US can get really expensive and it is mandatory for an international student to have an insurance. For insurance plans, clinical services and immunization requirements go through - <a href="http://studenthealth.utk.edu/">http://studenthealth.utk.edu/</a>.</font>
								</p>

								<p><font size="3"><strong>Student ID:</strong></font>
								</p>
								<p><font size="3">Student identification card is required to access most of the facilities in UTK. It is issued by the Vol Card office - <a href="http://volcard.utk.edu/">http://volcard.utk.edu/</a>.</font>
								</p>
								<p><font size="3"><strong>Social Security Number and State ID:</strong></font>
								</p>
								<p><font size="3">A nine-digit Social Security number (SSN) remains your first and continuous link with Social Security and the US government. It helps to accurately record your activities such as employments, visa status, stay, bank accounts, etc. SSN generally are assigned to people who are authorized to work in the United States. For international students, please see - <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10181.pdf">http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10181.pdf</a>.</br>

								Typically one does not carry SSN card and one cannot use student ID for identification purpose outside UTK campus. Passport works as the best proof of identify for city and state purposes but one does not like to carry it always. For this reason, it is always better to have a state ID which is typically a driving license issued by the US state. <a href="http://www.dmv.org/tn-tennessee/drivers-license.php">http://www.dmv.org/tn-tennessee/drivers-license.php</a></font></p></div></section></article>
